GCNs in PyTorch &amp;&amp; dataset is citeseer

Note: There are subtle differences between the TensorFlow implementation in https://github.com/tkipf/gcn and this PyTorch re-implementation. This re-implementation serves as a proof of concept and is not intended for reproduction of the results reported in [1].
